	* Include the <mlx.h> header
	* mlx_init(): Establishes a connection to the correct graphical system and returns a 'void *'
		which holds the location of our current MLX instance.
	* mlx_new_window(): Initializes a window
	** Open board; read it line-by-line "get_next_line()"; Store the height and width;
	** Store board into a string; free() the get_next_line() argument 'line'; close() board;
	*** Create path to XPM file and convert it to image before adding it to the display
	**** Add background tiles to the board
	**** Add sprites to the board
	***** move player sprite

	! I am iterating through the board using a string... and probrably should use a 2D array
	but I am not being able to convert it without segmentation fault...
		draw_board and read map needs to be re-writen for this...
		and then being able to "move" the player sprite

	! Player coordinates are inverted and that causes problems when changing tiles during movements...
		The problem was that I was sending the coordinates inverted in the convert_to_player()

	***	Smooth window (changing to another window, minimizing, etc);
	*** Close the window and quit the program when clicking in the red cross
	*** Add map error checking (Done)
	******BONUS****
	*** Add different sprites for different moves
	*** Add enemy
	*** Add screen moves count
	*** Add player animation on release (maybe)
	*** Exit in red cross - keycode 17 1L << 2 EVEN_EXIT_

	! Enemy colision not detected if there was a square between sprites before de colision...
	@ SOLVED "A" key does not work in movin enemies - if (keycode)
	@ Exit and seeds disapear if the enemy pass them
	@ Exit disapeares if I pass it before collecting all seeds
